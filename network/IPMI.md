## An overview of IPMI

The official definition of IPMI (short for Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based platform management systems making it possible to control and monitor servers centrally. The simpler definition is that IMPI is a security guard for your server.

Some primary functions of IMPI are to monitor hardware status (including temperatures, power consumption, voltage, etc.), log server data, and allow access to the server even when an operating system is not installed or is malfunctioning. It’s obviously quite handy for anyone concerned about the status of their servers and the information contained within.

## What is IPMI and what are its key benefits?

IPMI is a hardware solution for controlling and managing your servers. It has significant differences and benefits compared to system diagnosis software. For example, IPMI gives you the ability to manage servers in remote physical locations regardless of the installed operating system. This is because IPMI is an industry standard, developed by Intel in cooperation with Dell, Hewlett Packard, and NEC.

## IPMI key benefits:

  + It constantly monitors server health and issues advance warnings of possible system failures.
  + IPMI acts independently of the server and is always accessible.
  + Configuration changes are simple.
  + Enables user to access and make BIOS changes without SSH login or operating system access.
  + Server recovery is possible even if it’s switched off.
  + IMPI is a universal standard supported by the vast majority of hardware vendors.
