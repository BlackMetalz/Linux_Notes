Full-duplex data transmission means that data can be transmitted in both directions on a signal carrier at the same time. 
For example, on a local area network with a technology that has full-duplex transmission, one workstation can be sending data 
on the line while another workstation is receiving data. Full-duplex transmission necessarily implies a bidirectional 
line (one that can move data in both directions).
